## Importance of Learning Coding Interactively 

We'd like to learn how to write VB.NET instructions - in other words learn how to code - so we can pass a paper GCSE exam.  
Once we're confident about coding we'll be able to pass the exam - that will be no problem without a computer.  
But we can't learn by just writing on paper - not confidently at least. We really do need a computer for that.  
Trying to learn coding without a computer, is a bit like trying to learn to play tennis by just reading a book.  
In both cases - to learn confidently we have to feel what its like interactively.  

Today we're going to look at how we get our instructions to actually do something.  
We're going to put them onto a computer in the cloud which has VB.NET on it.  

## Minimum Interactivity - Building & Running - seeing what comes out of the box

The simplest thing we can ask the computer to do with our instructions is : to "build" and then "run" them.  
If we wrote valid instructions, and they produce some sort of output, then we'll see the output.  
More likely though, if the instructions weren't OK (because we're just learning !),  
the computer will produce a build error which tells us where we went wrong.  
That's a huge improvement !  
Without a computer the only way to find out whether our instructions are OK - is to ask someone to tell us, and then wait for an answer.  
But if we can get the computer to tell us, then we can find out straight away and keep having another go until they work.  
That's a much quicker way to learn, much more satisfying, and it often feels surprisingly quite fun.  

We'll look in detail at exactly what I mean by the words "build" and "run" in a minute.  
But to give you a basic idea first, it means putting our instructions into a box, and then feeding something into the box and seeing what comes out.  
If building and running was all we could do, by looking at what comes out of the box, and seeing whether it was what we intended, we'd be able to learn OK. 

## Extra Interactivity - Debugging - seeing what's happening in the box

But there's another thing we can do to help us learn even faster - that's called "debugging" - and it means looking inside the box.  
After we've looked at the detail of build and run something.  
We'll move on to looking in detail at debugging, and we'll see how looking inside the box gives us a much better idea of what's happening.  

## Detailed look at building and running - part 1 of 2 - orientation

So first - "building" -  
We need to put our instructions into a text file (we'll call it "Program.vb")  
Filenames are generally made up of two parts a name and an extension. The first bit - the name - can be anything we like.  
The second bit the extension indicates what type of file it is. In this case ".vb" stands for visual basic.  
Whenever we see a file with the extension .vb it means it contains instructions we can read and expect to understand (once we're confident with visual basic).   
Unfortunately the microprocessor, the hi-tech brain inside the computer which makes stuff happen, can't understand visual basic.  
Building means translating our visual basic text file, into a different kind of file which contains the same instructions,   
but in a different language which the microprocessor can understand (it will be called "Program.exe" or "Program.dll").  
The extension exe means the file is executable or runnable  
Which basically means it contains stuff we can ask the microprocessor to execute or to "run".
